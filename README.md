# Sorting Algorithms for Integer Arrays
We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.

## BubbleSort
The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.
The Algorithm is implemented in C

## RadixSort
The Radix Sort algorithm sorts rthe array in ascending order.
The Algorithm is implemented in C
